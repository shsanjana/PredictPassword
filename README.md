# Predict Password Strength 🔐
This repository contains a sample dataset used for predicting password strength.

> ⚠️ Note: The main code implementation is private.

## 📁 Dataset
- `password_data.csv` – Contains features like password length, use of symbols, etc.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to build a classification model that predicts password strength (Weak / Medium / Strong) based on features extracted from raw passwords.

## 🚫 Code Privacy
For security and research reasons, the code implementation is currently private. If you'd like access, feel free to request it via email or GitHub message.

## Project brief
Password - 1000k unique values for password collected online

Strength - three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong..
Strength of the password based on rules(such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.)


The passwords used in our analysis are from 000webhost leak that is available online
